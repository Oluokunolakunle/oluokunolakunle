## Hi,
- 🔭 I'm a chemistry graduate student at Tulane
- 🔭 I’m currently working on small molecules activation and Metal-Hydride chemistry
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and hope to use this in future for computational chemistry.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting small projects in Python.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love teaching, and spending time with my system.
